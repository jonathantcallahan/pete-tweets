    <div id='source-text'>Truly, If we merely divide ourselves by adopting clear and decisive policy that benefits not all Americans but the vast, overwhelming majority we have only allowed ourselves to exclude full unity from our midst. That's why we must stand boldly together and demand that we form a steadfast alliance with the captains of industry who really want from their politicians what we all want: a firmly united America. A gleaming pillar upon the mount where the vested interests of the few may illuminate the high road for the rich and poor alike. Each striving within the marketplace to bring food to our tables without rocking the boat. Together we can not only end poverty but end the divisiveness between billionaire mega-donor dark money super PAC oligarchs and all other Americans to bring a future for America that unites this great country from sea to sea, border to border, and across the globe.Isn't it time that we, as united citizens, look beyond our individual limitations and really ask ourselves if we need to strike such discord between Americans of all walks of life? If that means bridging the gap between the American middle class and, yes, even rich special interest astroturf campaigns funded by the Koch brothers, then maybe that is our path to uniting the nation. In these trying times how can we not reach across the aisle to accept the message that the American marketplace truly wants this nation to prosper in a way that accepts all voices equally.

Together we can not only end poverty but end the divisiveness between billionaire mega-donor dark money super PAC oligarchs and all other Americans to bring a future for America that unites this great country from sea to sea, border to border, and across the globe.We, as Americans, have gotten to hung up on populist policies that divide us to the point where we can no longer listen to the inspiring words that pave a bright and shining path to a better new tomorrow for all Americans. Isn't it time that we, as united citizens, look beyond our individual limitations and really ask ourselves if we need to strike such discord between Americans of all walks of life?

A gleaming pillar upon the mount where the vested interests of the few may illuminate the high road for the rich and poor alike. Each striving within the marketplace to bring food to our tables without rocking the boat. It really speaks to the inherent freedom that all Americans seek that we may not only find ourselves coming out of the closet to a welcoming community to turn back and find security and property in bounds that transcend our labels and identities; where we may finally achieve an economic security that our forefathers would approve of. It's amazing how truly clear it is to all Americans that a greater unity is needed if we are to unify together, not just some but all of us. We simply cannot allow ourselves to be divided by proposals that alienate those Americans who have gained so much freedom by working with Americans who want nothing more than to put bread on their tables at the end of the day, as Americans. With Trump in office we have to really put our nose to the grindstone and pull together. Not by dividing the nation against itself chasing Medicare for all, But by uniting ourselves, rich, poor, and those who enrich themselves through running insurance companies that work everyday, with everyday Americans who strive to receive the best healthcare in the world. From America's furthest reaches to the center of its heartland, countless people find themselves alienated from the country they have long known and loved. We truly have the freedom to rally ourselves, hardworking single parents alongside business magnates and captains of industry. If we can heed that rallying call, can't we all call ourselves "outsiders" at the end of the day? Truly, If we merely divide ourselves by adopting clear and decisive policy that benefits not all Americans but the vast, overwhelming majority we have only allowed ourselves to exclude full unity from our midst.
