     <div style='display:none' id='source-text'>Truly, If we merely divide ourselves by adopting clear and decisive policy that benefits not all Americans but the vast, overwhelming majority we have only allowed ourselves to exclude full unity from our midst. That's why we must stand boldly together and demand that we form a steadfast alliance with the captains of industry who really want from their politicians what we all want: a firmly united America. A gleaming pillar upon the mount where the vested interests of the few may illuminate the high road for the rich and poor alike. Each striving within the marketplace to bring food to our tables without rocking the boat. Together we can not only end poverty but end the divisiveness between billionaire mega-donor dark money super PAC oligarchs and all other Americans to bring a future for America that unites this great country from sea to sea, border to border, and across the globe.Isn't it time that we, as united citizens, look beyond our individual limitations and really ask ourselves if we need to strike such discord between Americans of all walks of life? If that means bridging the gap between the American middle class and, yes, even rich special interest astroturf campaigns funded by the Koch brothers, then maybe that is our path to uniting the nation. In these trying times how can we not reach across the aisle to accept the message that the American marketplace truly wants this nation to prosper in a way that accepts all voices equally.

Together we can not only end poverty but end the divisiveness between billionaire mega-donor dark money super PAC oligarchs and all other Americans to bring a future for America that unites this great country from sea to sea, border to border, and across the globe.We, as Americans, have gotten to hung up on populist policies that divide us to the point where we can no longer listen to the inspiring words that pave a bright and shining path to a better new tomorrow for all Americans. Isn't it time that we, as united citizens, look beyond our individual limitations and really ask ourselves if we need to strike such discord between Americans of all walks of life?

A gleaming pillar upon the mount where the vested interests of the few may illuminate the high road for the rich and poor alike. Each striving within the marketplace to bring food to our tables without rocking the boat. It really speaks to the inherent freedom that all Americans seek that we may not only find ourselves coming out of the closet to a welcoming community to turn back and find security and property in bounds that transcend our labels and identities; where we may finally achieve an economic security that our forefathers would approve of. It's amazing how truly clear it is to all Americans that a greater unity is needed if we are to unify together, not just some but all of us. We simply cannot allow ourselves to be divided by proposals that alienate those Americans who have gained so much freedom by working with Americans who want nothing more than to put bread on their tables at the end of the day, as Americans. With Trump in office we have to really put our nose to the grindstone and pull together. Not by dividing the nation against itself chasing Medicare for all, But by uniting ourselves, rich, poor, and those who enrich themselves through running insurance companies that work everyday, with everyday Americans who strive to receive the best healthcare in the world. From America's furthest reaches to the center of its heartland, countless people find themselves alienated from the country they have long known and loved. We truly have the freedom to rally ourselves, hardworking single parents alongside business magnates and captains of industry. If we can heed that rallying call, can't we all call ourselves "outsiders" at the end of the day? Truly, If we merely divide ourselves by adopting clear and decisive policy that benefits not all Americans but the vast, overwhelming majority we have only allowed ourselves to exclude full unity from our midst.

We simply cannot allow ourselves to be divided by proposals that alienate those Americans who have gained so much by working with Americans who want nothing more than to put bread on their tables at the end of the day, as Americans. There is nothing more self-evident: we all belong in this country. Our campaign is looking ahead—to the west, to the south, and to communities all across our country. At every step we’ll build the coalition that will defeat Donald Trump and put Trumpism in the dustbin of history. My 'Medicare For All Who Want It' plan will cover every American, and protect 14 million union workers who negotiated for strong plans and 22 million seniors who choose Medicare Advantage. We can't risk going into the most important election of our lives with a divisive approach that would eliminate private health care plans and health care choices for Americans. If you want to know what’s at stake in this election, just head over to a union hall and ask. Working families are fighting for the wages, health care, and the opportunities they deserve. I am standing with them in that fight. When people of color fear for their own place in their own country, when infants are torn from their parents at the border—the stakes could not be higher. We must end the era of Donald Trump. We can say to a Dreamer lying awake at night, questioning if this country is her own, that this country is your country too. We can say to a young woman in a headscarf enduring racial taunts, to a young man feeling fear instead of safety when he spots the lights of a police vehicle—you belong securely in the heart of the American project. Together we will deliver a democracy worthy of the name. No more manipulated districts, no more dollars outvoting people. And—whether that’s the Black vote in Georgia, the Native vote in North Dakota, or the student vote here in New Hampshire—no more voter suppression. Together we will deliver the day where your race has no bearing on your health, your wealth, your access to education, or your experience with law enforcement. This is the powerful majority we’re gathering together—it is a coalition of addition and not subtraction. A movement reaching into church basements and barbershops, into universities and union halls, carrying the same values everywhere we go. A fresh outlook is what makes new beginnings possible. And election after election has shown us that putting forward a new perspective is how Democrats win the White House. To win and to govern, we need to bring new voices to our capital. We need to get Washington working more like our best run cities and towns, rather than the other way around. Right now, there are so many LGBTQ+ people, especially young people, questioning whether they fit in their communities. We've got a long way to go before achieving full equality, but I hope they were watching tonight, with my husband in the audience, and know that they belong. I believe in American unity. I believe in American boldness. The idea that at a moment when Washington has never felt further from our lives, a middle-class mayor from the Midwest could carry the voices of the American people all the way to the American capital—and make sure they're actually heard. We must build an economy that works for everyone. That means lifting wages and empowering workers to overcome challenges that did not exist a generation ago.
